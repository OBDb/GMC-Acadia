    description: "The original GMC Acadia was a full-size crossover SUV built on GM's Lambda platform shared with the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, and Saturn Outlook. Featuring a unibody construction rather than the body-on-frame design of traditional GMC SUVs, it combined car-like handling with substantial interior space. Initially powered by a 3.6L V6 engine producing 275 HP (later upgraded to 288 HP), paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. The interior offered three rows of seating for up to eight passengers, with flexible seating arrangements and substantial cargo capacity. A significant refresh in 2013 updated the exterior styling, interior materials, and technology features. Available in various trim levels from the base SL to the luxury Denali, this generation established the Acadia as GMC's first crossover SUV and a practical alternative to traditional truck-based models, appealing to families seeking space and versatility without the fuel consumption and ride harshness of larger, truck-based SUVs."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Acadia marked a significant change in positioning, downsizing from a full-size to a mid-size crossover. Built on GM's C1XX platform, it was approximately 7 inches shorter and 700 pounds lighter than its predecessor. Engine options expanded to include a 2.5L four-cylinder and a 3.6L V6, with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder added in 2020. The interior maintained three-row seating but with reduced capacity for up to seven passengers, offering improved materials and technology including an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Special variants included the off-road-focused AT4 with enhanced capability features and the luxury Denali with premium appointments. A refresh in 2020 updated the exterior styling, transmission, and technology features. This generation repositioned the Acadia to compete in the highly competitive mid-size crossover segment, differentiating it more clearly from the larger Yukon in GMC's lineup."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current Acadia returns to a larger size, though not as large as the original generation, positioning it more clearly in the three-row midsize SUV segment. Built on GM's VSS-S platform, it features more rugged, truck-inspired styling aligned with GMC's design language. Powered by a standard 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder or an optional 3.6L V6 engine, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. The interior represents a significant advancement with higher quality materials, a standard 15-inch infotainment touchscreen, an 11-inch digital instrument cluster, and enhanced passenger space particularly in the third row. Seating configurations include six or seven-passenger arrangements depending on whether second-row captain's chairs are selected. Technology features include standard Super Cruise hands-free driving assistance, Google Built-in services, and comprehensive safety systems. The lineup continues to include the off-road AT4 and luxury Denali trims, with the latter featuring unique styling elements and premium appointments. This generation aims to better position the Acadia against three-row competitors like the Jeep Grand Cherokee L and Honda Pilot, offering enhanced capability and technology while maintaining GMC's professional grade identity."
